        from their most recent album, 2013's Forever Becoming, and one recently completed
        new song. Due out February 24 on 12\u201D vinyl and digital formats, the four
        track EP includes remixes from Justin Broadrick (of Godflesh, Jesu), Aaron

        No cheap juxtaposition, Epley\u2019s seasoned voice is as broad and astonishingly
        capable on \u201CThe Cliff\u201D as the members behind the music, a claim

        from 2009\u2019s What We All Come To Need will attest to. Elsewhere on the
        record, Justin Broadrick and AH/BCM turn in fresh takes of the source material,
        feeling less like remixes than new compositions reworked from the original
        source. Rounding out the set is the previously unreleased song \u201CThe Wait\u201D,
        a contemplative semi-acoustic simmer that builds to an explosion of cathartic
